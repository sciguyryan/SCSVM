Directives direct the compiler to perform an action while compiling the binary file. The current directives are outlined below. These must be placed within the data section.

----- [ DB and Friends - Declaring Initialized Data ]  -----

DB, DW, DD, DQ, DT, DO, DY and DZ are used to declare initialized data in the output file. They can be invoked in a wide range of ways:

db    $0x55					; Define a single byte with the value of 0x55. 
db    $0x55, $0x56, $0x57	; Define three bytes in sequence.
db    'a', $0x55			; Define a character (a single character string) and a byte literal in sequence.
db    'abcdefgh'			; Define a string, this will be converted into a byte sequence.

----- [ EQU - Define Constants ] -----


The EQU directive defines a constant by evaluating an expression.

Within these expressions a special variable ('#') is assigned to the current position within the output file while the binary is being compiled.

The following directive, for example, will set the strLen to the constant 13. This is value is obtained by: the current position within the output file minus the starting position of the "str" directive.

str db 'Hello, world!',$0xA
strLen equ #-str

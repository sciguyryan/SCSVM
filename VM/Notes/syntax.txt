Examples of the assembly syntax:

mov $42, R1
copies the literal 42 into R1.

mov R1, R2
copies the value from R1 to R2.

mov R1, &$0
move the value from R1 into memory starting at address literal 0.

mov [R1*R2], R3
move the value from memory into R3.
The memory address given by the expression:
	value of R1 multiplied by the value of R2.

mov R1, [R2+R3]
move the value from R1 into memory.
The memory address given by the expression:
	value of R1 plus the value of R2.

jne R1, &$100
if the accumulator is not equal to the value
of register R1 then jump to the address 100
(offset by the base address of the program region
within memory).

The base size of the memory plus the literal
equals the absolute memory address, so the literal
is treated an address relative within the program
memory region.

jne R1, @GOOD
if the accumulator is not equal to the value
of register R1 then jump to the address specified by
the label "GOOD".
